This website is a hub for the lessons I create during my studies.\nPlease feel free to contact me at any of my listed links.\n\n\nCareer\nI’m currently a bioinformatics scientist working in predictive sciences for drug development.\nI am experienced in bioinformatics, analytics, software engineering, and machine learning.\n\n\nEducation\nPrior to starting my career, I completed my Ph.D. in Neuroscience at West Virginia University from 2019-2023, where I studied circadian rhythms, pain, and cerebrovasculature in Randy Nelson’s lab.\nBefore that, I was a completed my B.M. (Bachelor of Music) from 2015-2019 at West Virginia University, where I studied piano performance with Ching-Wen Hsiao and learned the ropes of biomedical research in Paul Lockman’s lab.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
