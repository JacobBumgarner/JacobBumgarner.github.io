My name is Jacob Bumgarner. I'm an avid learner with a passion for creating and
writing. This website serves as a central hub for the insights and lessons I
create while exploring new concepts and revisiting topics of interest.

Please feel free to reach out or connect with me through the links above.

### Career
I am a bioinformatics scientist specializing in predictive sciences for drug
development, currently part of a precision discovery team. We use reverse
translational approaches to identify novel drug targets.

My experience encompasses bioinformatics, data analytics, software engineering,
and machine learning. I am driven by a passion for problem-solving and applying
my skills to improve human health.

### Education 
Prior to starting my career, I completed my Ph.D. in Neuroscience at West
Virginia University from 2019-2023, where I studied circadian rhythms, pain, and
cerebrovasculature in [Randy
